# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a <%= @api_only ? 'API-only' : 'full-stack' %> Rails application using <%= @test_framework || 'Rails default testing' %>.

## Claude on Rails Subagents

This project has Rails development subagents configured in `.claude/agents/`. 
The `rails-architect` subagent orchestrates specialized agents for different Rails domains.

To start Rails development, mention "rails-architect" or describe what you want to build.

## Common Development Commands

### Running the Application
```bash
rails server
# or
rails s
```

### Database Commands
```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails db:rollback
```

### Testing
```bash
<% if @test_framework == 'RSpec' %>
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test file
bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb

# Run tests matching a pattern
bundle exec rspec spec/models
<% else %>
# Run all tests
rails test

# Run specific test file
rails test test/models/user_test.rb

# Run specific test
rails test test/models/user_test.rb:15
<% end %>
```

### Console

rails console
# or
rails c
```

### Routes
```bash
rails routes
# or search for specific routes
rails routes | grep user
```

## Development Workflow

1. Use Claude on Rails subagents for feature development
2. Run tests frequently during development
3. Check routes when adding new endpoints
4. Use Rails console for debugging and data inspection
